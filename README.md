<a href="https://assembly.com/saulify/bounties"><img src="https://asm-badger.herokuapp.com/saulify/badges/tasks.svg" height="24px" alt="Open Tasks" /></a>

Got a hard-to-read website? [Better call Saul](http://saulify.me) to clean it up!

Saulify runs on Heroku: [http://saulify.heroku.com](http://saulify.heroku.com)

#### Installing Locally

Saulify is built on [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/) micro-framework. 

To install it locally:

- [Clone this Github repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/) to your local computer.
- Install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and ensure you create a Heroku account if you don't have one already.
- Install [virtualenv-burrito](https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito) to install a tool for managing your Python virtual environments.
- Use `mkvirtualenv saulify` to create a new virtual environment for the project. This will ensure all of your Python libraries are installed properly without conflict.
- Use `cd <saulify folder path>` to change to the Saulify directory and then `workon saulify` to switch to the Saulify virtual environment you created previously.
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the 3rd party dependencies, such as Flask, et. al.
- Set up a `.env` file in the root Saulify directory with the environment variables taken from the Heroku config: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars (Ask a team member to send you the file if you don't have access)
- Type `foreman run python runserver.py` (for development) or `foreman start` (for production) at the command line to start the local server.

Note: Saulify uses the [Newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) library for scraping website articles. If you have trouble installing it on Mac OS X Yosemite during the `pip install` process above, please see this [Github issue](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper/issues/79) for helpful info.
