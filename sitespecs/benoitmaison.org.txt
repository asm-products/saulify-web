body: //div[@class="entry-content"]

# Remove text &lsquo;Tweet&rsquo;
strip: //div[@class="entry-content"]/div[last()]

title: h1[@class="entry-title"]

# If the Instapaper text parser worked with HTML5 tags, we would use:
date: //time[@class="entry-date"]

# But since it does not, use this more complicated rule:
date: //div[@class="entry-meta"]/a[@rel="bookmark"]

# Unfortunately, the following rule is overridden by the automatically found author.
