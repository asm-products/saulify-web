title: normalize(//h1)

author: //td/p[position()=last()]/em

# I swear, this is really the best way to do this
date: normalize(//td[contains(@style, "color: #ffffff")])

# my god, it's full of tables
body: /table/tbody/tr[5]//table/tbody//table/tbody/tr/td
strip: //h1

# the following two lines strip the byline at the end of the article (the byline is a <p> that consists of an em dash and then some text in an <em>). I have no idea why I can't just strip //p[position()=last()], but trying to do so includes a bunch of other crap in the output.
strip: //p[position()=last()]/em
strip: //p[position()=last()]/child::text()
